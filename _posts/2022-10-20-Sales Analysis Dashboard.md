## Description
**What** - A monthly Sales Analysis dashboard focusing on sales, margins, volumes and conversions summarizes the sales performance for the month which helps to determine the effectiveness of the sales strategy. Usually, the first page of a dashboard contains the most important KPIâ€™s and the others  show the trends and figures.

**Who** - Sales teams, mostly c-level executives, use these reports to find trends and insights to improve the quality of their products and services. 

**Why** - A month dashboard provides a broader feeling of how the sales reps are performing in the long run. It focuses on more long-term measurement of KPIs such as sales cycle length, conversion report, and monthly progress report, among many others.

**How** - This Dashboard was created by Power BI after data-cleansing step in Power Query.
