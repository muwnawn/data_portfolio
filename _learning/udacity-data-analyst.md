## Overview
This program prepares learners for a career as a data analyst by helping them learn to organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. Learners will develop proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as they build a portfolio of projects to showcase in their job search.

This nanodegree advances learner programming skills and refine their ability to work with messy, complex datasets. Learner will learn to manipulate and prepare data for analysis, and create visualizations for data exploration. Finally, learner will learn to use your data skills to tell a story with data.

## Syllabus
### Introduction to Data Analysis
Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Work with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
#### Project 1: Explore Weather Trends
This project will introduce learners to the SQL and how to download data from a database. They’ll analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where they live to overall global temperature trends.

#### Project 2: Investigate a Dataset
In this project, learners will choose one of Udacity’s curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. They’ll complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing their findings.

### Practical Statistics
Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.
#### Project 3: Analyze Experiment Results
In this project, learners will be provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. They’ll use statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report their conclusions and recommendations in a report.

### Data Wrangling
Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. Learn to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.
#### Project 4: Wrangle & Analyze Data
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python, learners will gather data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. They’ll document their wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.

### Data Visualization with Python
Learn to apply visualization principles to the data analysis process. Explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.
#### Project 5: Communicate Data Findings
Learners will use Python’s data visualization tools to systematically explore a selected dataset for its properties and relationships between variables. Then, they will create a presentation that communicates their findings to others.
