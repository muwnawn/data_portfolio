## 2. CLASSIFYING AND SUMMARIZING DATA
### 2.1. Classifying Data
#### Qualitative (Categorical) - Định tính
* Binary – where there are two choices, e.g. Male and Female
* Ordinal – where the names imply levels with hierarchy or order of preference, e.g. level of education
* Nominal – where no hierarchy is implied, e.g. political party affiliation.
	For example, for coding purposes, you may assign Male as 0, Female as 1. The numbers 0 and 1 stand only for the two categories and there is no order between them.

#### Quantitative Data - Định lượng	
* Discrete - or “counted” as in the number of people in attendance
* Continuous - or “measured” as in the weight or height of a person.

### 2.2. Samples and Statistics
Samples	is a representative group drawn from the population.
Statistics is any summary number, like an average or percentage, that describes the sample.

### 2.3. Statistics Techniques
Descriptive statistics:	describe data in ways to capture the essence of the information in the data
Inferential statistics:	draw conclusions from data about the population
