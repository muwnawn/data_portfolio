## 1. FOUNDATION
### 1.1. Populations and Parameters
<img align = "right" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQJCMXUDZGeezz8p7LF9OO18EVC0P0_tsKP9w&usqp=CAU">

- Population is any large collection of objects or individuals.
- Parameters is any summary number, like an average or percentage, that describes the entire population.

### 1.2. Samples and Statistics
- Samples is a representative group drawn from the population.
- Statistics is any summary number, like an average or percentage, that describes the sample.

### 1.3. Statistics Techniques
- Descriptive statistics:	describe data in ways to capture the essence of the information in the data
- Inferential statistics:	draw conclusions from data about the population

### 1.4. Measures of Central Tendency
- Mean: the average of data - easily affected by extreme values (Outliers)
- Median: middle value of the ordered data
- Mode: the value that occurs most often - may be more than one mode

### 1.5. Measures of Position
- Percentile: If you have a 95th percentile score then you are at or above 95% of all test takers. 
- Quartiles

### 1.6. Measures of Variability
- Range
- Variance: measures how far each number in the set is from the mean (average)
- Standard Deviation: approximately the average distance the values of a data set are from the mean - the square root of the variance

## 2. DISTRIBUTIONS
<!-- PROBABILITY -->
### 2.1. Probability Distributions
- Mean: the average of data - easily affected by extreme values (Outliers)
- Median: middle value of the ordered data
- Mode: the value that occurs most often - may be more than one mode
<!-- - Z-score: distance from mean = (datapoint - mean)/SD
- Empirical rule -->

### 2.2. Sampling Distributions
- Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean



- Sampling Distribution of the Sample Proportion

## 3. HYPOTHESIS TESTING FOR ONE SAMPLE
### 3.1. Some term
- Confidence Intervals
- of errors:

### 3.2. Step
